If you do not agree to this Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use Switch. </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 1. APP TERMS </h5> <p> We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free licence to use the App and software embedded in it to open and manage your account. This licence will terminate immediately when you delete the App. </p> <p> The use of this App is intended solely for persons who are 18 years or older.

Also, if you do not (or you do not upgrade your phone’s operating system to the latest version available), certain features of the App may not work as intended. We are not responsible for the performance of the App on your phone if you do not update the App or your phone’s operating system to the latest version available. </p> <p> The App is provided for convenience. You acknowledge that the App (and the services/products provided through the App) is dependent upon other people (third parties). We try to ensure that the App services are available to you at all times, though we can't promise that it will always be available or work perfectly (for example, in the case of maintenance, fraud, or a fault in the systems used to provide the App). These events are sometimes outside of our control. </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 2.

SECURITY </h5> <p> When you download the App, you will be required to provide certain Security Information. For the purpose of this Term of Use, Security Information mean the information we request from you (including through the App or when we open your Sterling account) to ensure your account and your use of the App remain secure. </p> <p> You are responsible for keeping your phone, the App and the Security Information secure and confidential. You must let us know as soon as possible if you think anyone else has your Security Information or has otherwise managed to unlawfully access your account. We will never ask you for your passcode, PIN or password, so you must not share these with other people, even if you think they work for us. </p> <p> You are responsible for (and agree to hold us harmless from) unauthorised access or changes to, or transactions on, your account(s) resulting from shared access to your device or other people having access to your App's Security Information.  </p> <p class="text-bold"> Identification and Verification </p> <p> You agree to cooperate with all requests made by us to identify you and verify your identity and we may make this conditional for granting you access, or continued access, to the App or parts of its functionality. This verification may include asking you for information so we can identify you, requiring you to take a photo of your identification documents or provide copies or the original for sighting. We may verify your information against third party databases or through other sources. </p> <p> You must ensure the information in your App is always accurate and up to date. If at any time we believe that your information is outdated or inaccurate, we may require you to update this information and we may require you to through the identification and verification process again.  </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 4. SERVICES <small>/</small> FUNCTIONS OF THE APP </h5> <p> The App includes the following major functions: </p> <p> <span class="text-bold">Savings</span> </p> <p> <span class="text-bold">Investments</span> </p> <p> <span class="text-bold">Insurance</span> </p> <p> <span class="text-bold">Payments</span><br>When you initiate a payment by entering the required details into the App you explicitly consent and authorise us to make the payment to the recipient you have provided. It is your responsibility to check all details are accurate as Sterling cannot validate or check these details. If you are initiating payments related to a purchase then the relationship for that purchase remains between you and the relevant supplier – Sterling is in no way responsible for that purchase or any terms set by that supplier. If you think that a payment initiated through Switch may have been incorrect, unauthorised, or not properly executed (perhaps due to delay or other error), then you need to: contact us immediately (using <a href="mailto:support@switch-ng.com">support@switch-ng.com</a>) so that we can investigate and stop the payment if possible. </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 5. PARTNERS AND OTHER CONTENT </h5> <p> Switch offers you the possibility to purchase products and services of third parties (“Partners”). We will provide information on third party products or services that you may be interested in. We may use third party suppliers to support us in providing the App. We take reasonable care in selecting our suppliers so as to protect your security. </p> <p> We only share your personal data if you consent to purchase products and services of a Partner. Only after such consent will we disclose or prefill your personal data to those third parties so that they can provide their services to you and give you a smooth user experience. We won't disclose more than is needed for the products and services of that Partner. </p> <p class="text-bold"> If you purchase products or services from our Partners that you have connected with via the App, you will enter into a direct contract with those Partners or the providers that our Partners introduce you to. These are all third-party products and service, not Sterling products or services - we do not assume any responsibility or liability for those third-party products or services. </p> <p> We suggest to always carefully ready the terms and conditions connected to the Partner products and services and the information they provide in relation to those products or services. Partners might change their products or services in some cases. Sterling cannot check or validate this - it is your responsibility and we cannot be held liable or responsible for it. </p> <p> The App does not provide financial planning services, or tax or financial advice, we only help you in suggesting relevant products and services of our Partners and enabling you to easily access these. As such: </p> <ul> <li> we do not assume any responsibility or liability for Partners’ products and services, or products or services that they introduce you to; and </li> <li> We are not responsible for any content or representations our Partners make about products or services. </li> </ul> <p class="mt-20"> If you have questions on the Partner products and services, we will endeavour to provide you with information within our knowledge. Alternatively, we may ask you to directly contact the Partners and provide you with their contact details. </p> <p> We take reasonable care to select trustworthy Partners and do a due diligence check on them before they can enter our platform, so we will check e.g. that they are duly licensed. But these Partners do not work for us, nor do we control them, so it is your own duty to always check if a Partner fits your needs or if the offers make sense for you. Sterling does not assume any liability or responsibility for the act or omissions of our Partners or the products or services they offer. </p> <p> You can always disconnect a Partner from the App but be aware that this does not automatically cancel or stop the products or services you have purchased with them. This is not something Sterling can do for you, so please revert to the Partner for this. </p> <p> We reserve the right to disconnect a Partner from the App or to stop making their products and services available and visible within the App. </p> <p> We will always impose strict obligation on our Partners to adhere to privacy legislation, but we don’t assume any responsibility for how they adhere to this or how they protect or process your data or design their security. Please read the applicable section on Partner Platform in our Privacy Policy to find details about this.  </p> <p> Our Partners may ask you to read or accept terms and conditions and details about their products and services. Please ensure you read them. </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 6. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENCE </h5> <p> All trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights of any nature in the App (including its appearance and branding), together with the underlying software code, are owned by Sterling or its licensors. We may also use open source software code in the App. Sterling grants you a revocable right to use the App for your personal (non-commercial) use in accordance with these App Terms. </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 7. DATA PROTECTION </h5> <p> Any personal information you supply to us (and which we collect from you or other sources) will be used by us in accordance with our <router-link :to="{name: 'PrivacyPolicy'}">Privacy Policy</router-link> . By using the App, you explicitly consent to us collecting and using technical information about your usage and device to improve our products and to provide any services to you. </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 8. SUSPENDING AND STOPPING YOUR USE OF THE APP </h5> <p class="text-bold"> By Us </p> <p> We may suspend or end your use of the App (or part of it, such as payment initiation or connections to products and services from our Partners) at any time. We will usually inform you when this is happening, but we can't always do so. We might take this action: </p> <ul> <li> if you breach App Terms, for the reasons outlined below in this section;  </li> <li> in the event we are unable to identify you or authenticate your identity or validate your funding sources; and </li> <li> in other circumstances where we believe that there is a valid reason (such as for risk or fraud management, or at your request if you suspect fraud.  </li> </ul> <p> We have no obligation to resume provision of the App or services to you, or to re-activate your User Login, if suspended or closed. If we permanently end your use of the App then: (a) the rights granted to you in these App Terms end, and (b) you must stop use of the App and remove it from your devices. </p> <p> If you are inactive then your User Login could automatically be suspended, and you will be required to create a new User Login. </p> <p> If we suspect that that your App's security has been breached, or we suspect unauthorised or fraudulent use of the App, then we may suspend its use. If we do this, then we will (if the law permits) try to contact you (normally by email) to let you know. </p> <p> We may also need to limit, block or stop your usage if we are required to do so by law.  </p> <p> You agree to provide us with information that we may request in order for us to carry out necessary checks. </p> <p> In some cases, to enable us to lift a limit, suspension or other stop on your use of the App, we may need you to provide us with further information.  </p> <p class="text-bold"> By You </p> <p> You may stop your use of the App at any time by removing the App from your device. Doing so will not automatically delete your user information that we hold. You can delete your user information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@switch-ng.com">support@switch-ng.com</a> and we can delete it for you. We will also stop making your information available for active use after 1 year of inactivity on the App. When your App or user information is deleted, we will continue to hold certain information about you and your use for as long as it is required to enable us to comply with legal requirements, and for operational reasons such as issue resolution, complaint handling and “Know Your Customer” regulation.

As such and subject to clause 10 of these App Terms, if we are liable to you in relation to Switch and it relates to us not having met our obligations under the applicable law to protect your information or keep it secure, or it relates to any obligation under the applicable law that we cannot exclude (or limit, to the extent that it cannot be limited), then we accept that liability in full as required by the law; or it relates to any other cause (regardless of the form of the action or timing) then we will only be liable to you for loss or damage that you personally suffer that is a foreseeable result of all such causes up to a maximum of N500 (Five Hundred Naira) in total.  </p> <p> We are not responsible or liable if the relevant cause arises from your breach or action (such as your fraud or us following your instructions), events outside of our control, or the need to comply with our legal obligations.

HOW WE ARE FUNDED </h5> <p> The App is completely free to use. There is no subscription charge or price. Yet, behind the scenes, we are a big team and we need to keep the App growing for you. To fund some of this we do receive payments if you choose to use or purchase third party products and services linked from our Partner Platform. We don't compromise ourselves by using those that will give us the largest payments – we always look for the best fit and service for the users of Switch.  </p> <br> <h5 class="mt-50 mb-20 text-bold"> 12. PROBLEMS, QUESTIONS & COMPLAINTS </h5> <p> Switch appreciates it greatly if you notify us of a question or problem, because this gives us the opportunity to seek a suitable solution.

We will do this to keep you informed of matters relevant to the App, where we need to in order to comply with our legal obligations - further details are shown in our Privacy Policy. In some circumstances, it may also be appropriate for us to contact you through other means (such as telephone) where you have provided your number to us and it's helpful to talk things through. When we communicate with you (including by telephone) it is common for us to monitor and keep a record of that communication for quality and training purposes. </p> <p> Please remember to tell us if your details change.

You may not transfer your rights or obligations to another person. </p> <p> If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. Any waiver would need to be given by us in writing.  </p> <p> Each of the conditions of these App Terms operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect. </p> <p> Please note that these App Terms, their subject matter and formation, are governed by the Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You and we both agree that the Nigerian courts will have exclusive jurisdiction. </p> <p> These App Terms and our Privacy Policy are drawn up in the English language.
